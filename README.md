# get_social

Social media scraping app created with python. 

What this app do is:

1. Takes a webpage as an input, checks it's current status code & If website's status code == 200 then gives an option to scrape social media links
![bash view](gifs/type_website_url.gif)

4. Prints & Saves those links into separate .txt file
![bash view 2](gifs/download_social_links.gif)

Please note that this is my first app, but I'm definitely open to critique and other ideas.

Happy Coding!!!
