# get_social

Social media scraping app created with python. 

What this app basically do is:

1. Takes webpage as an input
2. Checks it's current status code
3. If website's status code == 200 then gives an option to scrape social media links
4. Saves those links into separate .txt file

Please note that this is my first app, but I'm definitely open to critique
